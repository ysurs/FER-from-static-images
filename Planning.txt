Interpretation:

1. Preprocessing of images is being done intially.
2. Batching etc is being done after that.





Implementation notes:

1. All images must be preprocessed first- all 1635 images must be preprocessed- no batching required.
2. ckplus dataset is different from the paper.
3. Default implementation is not doing bilinear interpolation- I have included that in mine. After including it in the authors code,
my logic in dataset.py and default code gives same result.
4. clahe is also implemented for all images- take a for loop and implement clahe for each image in the dataset.
5. I have used: ssd.ssd300_vgg16(weights=ssd.SSD300_VGG16_Weights.DEFAULT) for detecting face crops- need to confirm this with the authors
6. face crop detection is taking too much time- have to confirm which method was adopted by the authors.
7. I have added a main function in preprocessing.py. The idea is to perform all clahe and face crop detection for all images
and then use the resulting stored numpy arrays for the model
8. face crop detection has been refactored- loaded model in __init__ method hence now the time taken is less.
9. Now i have all images in my dataset of shape (160,160,3)
10. face detection is not working on images: './CK+_Complete/surprise/S124_001_00000014.png' and './CK+_Complete/surprise/S124_001_00000013.png'
which are at index 1576 and 1630 respectively. It is also not working on image at index 1629
11. Not sure about the train validation split





Comments:

1. About CK+ dataset, will it be provided or should It be downloaded- I have downloaded it.
2. In my dataset, only 7 expressions are present.



Question:
1. what is the reason for clahe parameters- why those specific numbers
2. is my face detection method right ?
